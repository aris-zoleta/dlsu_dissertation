Meyer At the AEA Panel on Monetary and Fiscal Policy, New Orleans, Louisiana January 5, The Role for Structural Macroeconomic Models I am in the middle of my third interesting and active encounter with the development and/or use of macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis. My journey began at MIT as a research assistant to Professors Franco Modigiliani and Albert Ando during the period of development of the MPS model, continued at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates with the development of The Washington University Macro Model under the direction of my partner, Joel Prakken, and the use of that model for both forecasting and policy analysis, and now has taken me to the Board of Governors where macro models have long played an important role in forecasting and policy analysis and the MPS model has recently been replaced by the FRB/US model. I bring to this panel a perspective shaped by both my earlier experience and my new responsibilities. I will focus my presentation on the role of structural macro models in the monetary policy process, compare the use of models at the Board with their use at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, and discuss how the recently introduced innovations in the Federal Reserve model might further advance the usefulness of models in the monetary policy process. I. Structural Models and Monetary Policy Analysis I want to focus on three contributions of models to the monetary policy process: as an input to the forecast process; as a vehicle for analyzing alternative scenarios; and a vehicle for developing a strategy for implementing monetary policy that disciplines the juggling of multiple objectives and ensures a bridge from short-run policy to long-run objectives. 1. The forecast context for monetary policy decisions Because monetary policy has the ability to adjust quickly to changing economic conditions and because lags in the response to monetary policy make it important that monetary policy be forward looking, monetary policy is very much influenced both by incoming data and by forecasts of spending and price developments. Forecasts are central to monetary policy setting. Models make a valuable contribution to forecasting. Therefore, models can make an important contribution to the setting of monetary policy. Models capture historical regularities, identify key assumptions that must be made to condition the forecast, embody estimates of the effects of past and future policy actions on the economy, and provide a disciplined approach to learning from past errors. I attribute much of the forecasting success of myself and my partners at LHM&A to the way in which we allowed our model to discipline our judgment in making the forecast. A model also helps to defend and communicate the forecast, by providing a coherent story that ties together the details of the forecast. It also helps to isolate the source of disagreements about the forecast,  helping to separate differences in assumptions (oil prices, fiscal policy, etc.) from disagreements about the structure of the economy or judgments about special factors that the model may not fully capture. At the Board, the staff forecast, presented in the Greenbook prior to each of the eight FOMC meetings each year, is fundamentally judgmental. It is developed by a team of sector specialists who consult, but are not bound by, a number of structural econometric equations describing their sectors, and further armed, in some cases, with reduced-form equations and atheoretical time series models. The team develops the forecast within the context of agreed- upon conditioning assumptions, including, for example, a path for short-term interest rates, fiscal policy, oil prices, and foreign economic policies. They begin with an income constraint and then participate in an interactive process of revisions to ensure that the aggregation of sector forecasts is consistent with the evolving forecast for the overall level of output. Models play an important supporting role in the development of the staff forecast. A separate model group uses a formal structural macroeconometric model, the FRB/US Model, to make a \\\"pure model\\\" forecast which is also available to the FOMC and is an input to the judgmental forecast process. The model forecast is conditioned by the same set of assumptions as the judgmental forecast and statistical models are used to generate the path of adjustment factors, avoiding any role for judgment in the forecast. The members of the model group also actively participate in the discussions as the judgmental forecast evolves, focusing in particular on the consistency between the adjustment factors that would be required to impose the judgmental forecast on the model and the pattern of adjustment factors in the \\\"pure\\\" model forecast. There are two important differences from the private sector use of models for forecasting, at least based on my experience at LHM&A. First, the staff is not truly making a forecast of economic activity, prices, etc., because the staff forecast is usually conditioned on an unchanged path of the funds rate. Thus the staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate (which does not even always translate cleanly into no change in monetary policy). The rationale for this procedure is to separate the forecast process from the policy making process, and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMC's decisions. This procedure may be modified when there is a strong presumption that conditions will unambiguously call for significant action if the Committee is to achieve its objectives. But it does, nevertheless, make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the private sector where one of the key decisions in the forecast is the direction of monetary policy. It is ironic that, at the Board, where the staff is presumably more knowledgeable about the direction of policy than in the private sector, forecasting is constrained from using that information in developing the forecast. On the other hand, the practice at the Board may be very well suited to the process of making policy by forcing the FOMC to confront the implications of maintaining an unchanged path for the funds rate. A second difference relative to my experience in the private sector has to do with the way in which judgment and model interact in the development of the forecast. My first impression of the process at the Board was that the judgmental team made its forecast without a model  and the model team made its forecast without judgment, leaving the blending of model and judgment to be worked out in the process of discussion and iteration as the judgmental group looks at the model output and the model group joins the discussion of the forecast. The process is, I have come to appreciate, more complicated and subtle than this caricature. For example, when there have been important shocks (e.g., unexpected rise in oil prices or an increase in the minimum wage), model simulations of the effect of the shocks will provide a point of departure for the initial judgmental forecast. But it is nevertheless, a different way of combining model and judgment than we used at LHM&A where the model played a more central role in the forecast process. An advantage of the Board's approach is that it makes the forecast less dependent on a single model (perhaps desirable given the diversity of views on the FOMC) and forces recognition of uncertainties in the outlook when alternative sector models yield very different forecasts. Return to top 2. Policy alternatives and alternative scenarios to support FOMC policy decisions A second valuable contribution of models is to provide alternative scenarios around a base forecast. I will focus on three examples of this use models at the Board, though there is also, of course, widespread use of alternative model-based scenario analysis in the private sector. First, the staff regularly provides alternative forecasts roughly corresponding to the policy options that will be considered at the upcoming FOMC meeting. The staff first imposes the judgmental forecast on the FRB/US model and then uses the model to provide alternative scenarios for a policy of rising rates and a policy of declining rates, bracketing the staff forecast which assumes an unchanged federal funds rate. While this is the most direct use of the model in the forecast process, it is recognized that it has become a problematical one, especially given the structure of the new FRS/US model that otherwise treats policy as determined by a rule, a prerequisite to the forward-looking approach to expectations formation that is a major innovation in the new model. Indeed, it might well be that the presentation of a forecast that incorporates a simple monetary policy rule might be a more useful complement to the staff's judgmental forecast than the mechanical bracketing of the judgmental forecast with pre-determined paths of rising or falling rates. Second, the staff, on occasion, uses the model to provide information about the projected effects of significant contingencies: e.g., the return of Iraq to oil exporting under the U.N. agreement for humanitarian aid or the effect of an increase in the minimum wage. Models are particularly well suited to providing this information. Third, the model can be used to evaluate the consistency of alternative policies with the Federal Reserve's long-run objective of price stability. One of the challenges of monetary policy making is to ensure that the meeting-to-meeting policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserve's long-term price stability objective. To facilitate this focus, five-year simulations under alternative policy assumptions are generally run semi-annually, to coincide with the FOMC meetings preceding the preparation of the Humphrey-Hawkins report and the Chairman's testimony on monetary policy before Congress. These simulations have recently focused on policy options allowing for more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long-run inflation targets, allowing the  FOMC to focus on both the different time-paths to achieve the long-run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long-run target. Return to top 3. Policy rules to inform discretionary monetary policy A third contribution of models to the monetary policy process is through simulations with alternative rules for Federal Reserve action. At LHM&A we designed our model to offer users four policy regimes: setting paths for the money supply, nonborrowed reserves or the federal funds rate or turning on a reaction function according to which the federal funds rate responds to developments in output, unemployment and inflation. While we increasingly used the reaction function in our analysis of alternative fiscal policies, we did not routinely take advantage of the reaction function to forecast monetary policy. Another irony is that there is a much more active interest in the implications of monetary policy rules at the Board, where discretionary policy is made, than in the private sector, where estimated rules might be effectively used to forecast monetary policy. The staff has examined a number of alternative rules, including those based on monetary aggregates, commodity prices, exchange rates, nominal income, and, most recently, Taylor- type rules. These rules, in effect, adjust the real federal funds rate relative to some long-run equilibrium level in response to the gaps between actual and potential output and between inflation and some long-run inflation target. Such a rule can be interpreted as either a descriptive or normative guide to policy. If the parameters of the policy rule are estimated over some recent sample period, the rule may describe the average response of the FOMC over the period. Alternatively, parameters can be derived from some optimizing framework, dependent on a specific objective function and model of the economy. Stochastic simulations with such a rule can provide some confidence that following the rule will contribute to both short-run stabilization and long-term inflation goals in response to historical shocks to the economy and the rule, in turn, can provide discipline to discretionary policy by providing guidance on when and how aggressively to move interest rates in response to movements in output and inflation. The focus on rules is much more important under an interest rate operating procedure than under an operating procedure focused directly on monetary aggregate targets and is also more important under an interest rate operating procedure when the monetary aggregates, as has been the case for some time, do not bear a stable relationship to overall economic performance and therefore do not provide useful information about when and how aggressively to change interest rates. Taylor-type rules, in this environment, provide a disciplined approach to varying interest rates in response to economic developments that both ensures a pro-cyclical response of interest rates to demand shocks and imposes a nominal anchor in much the same way as would be the case under a monetary aggregate strategy with a stable money demand function. For this reason, I like to refer to the strategy implicit in such rules as \\\"monetarism without money.\\\"  This should not suggest that we can write a rule that is appropriate in all circumstances, to all varieties of shocks, and to all the varieties of cyclical experience. Rules, at best, can discipline judgment rather than replace judgment. A particular problem with Taylor-type rules is that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and, whatever it might be at one point in time, it likely varies over time. There is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability and provide guidance about patterns and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments consistent with the stabilizing properties of high performing rules. Return to top II. The FRB-US Model: Rational Expectations in a Sticky-Price Model The newly redesigned model at the Board, the FRB-US model, replaces the MPS model. The MPS model, developed in the mid to late 1960s, revolutionized macroeconometric modeling and set the standard for a considerable period of time. The Board participated in the development of the MPS model and then became its home and the Board staff kept the faith alive during the lean years when such models lost respectability in academic circles, even as their usefulness and value in forecasting and practical policy analysis was growing in the \\\"real\\\" world. The FRB-US model retains much of the underlying structure in terms of equilibrium relationships and even more of the fundamental simulation properties of the MPS model, but significantly modernizes the estimation of the model and the treatment of expectations. The vision in the new work is to separate macro-dynamics into adjustment cost and expectations formation components, with adjustment costs imposing a degree of inertia and expectations introducing a forward-looking element into the dynamics. The net result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky price model. In this respect, the new model follows closely the approach pioneered by John Taylor. Finally, the estimation technique makes use of co-integration and an error-correction framework. Financial and exchange rate relationships are based on arbitrage equations, with no adjustment costs but with explicitly forward-looking expectations. The specification of nonfinancial equations, in contrast, incorporates both adjustment costs and rational expectations. Rational expectations are implemented in two alternative ways. First, expectations can be specified as \\\"model consistent\\\" expectations; that is, the expectations about future inflation can be set to equal future inflation (perfect foresight) through iterative solutions of the model. Model-consistent expectations may, but need not, assume that the private sector has complete knowledge of the policy rule being followed by the Federal Reserve. In the second approach, expectations are also viewed as being model consistent, but in this case the model relevant to expectations is not precisely the same as the FRB/US model. Instead, expectations are formed based on a simpler VAR model of the economy. The VAR model always includes three variables--the output gap, a short-term interest rate, and inflation. When expectations of additional sector-specific variables are required, the system is  expanded to include the additional variable. A unique aspect of the VAR expectations is that these equations also incorporate explicit forward-looking information through an error correction specification. For example, the VAR equations include a term for the gap between actual inflation and the public's \\\"long-run\\\" expectations of inflation, based on survey measures of long-run inflation expectations which, in turn, might be viewed as based on a combination of the public's perception of the Federal Reserve's reaction function, including its tolerance of inflation over the long run. The equations also include the gap between actual short-term interest rates and the public's long-run expectations of short-term rates, gleaned from the yield curve. The model retains the neo-Classical synthesis vision of the MPS model--short-run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long-run Classical properties associated with price flexibility--and therefore produces multiplier results, both in the short and longer runs, that are very similar to those produced by the MPS model. The result is that the model produces, for the most part, what may be the best of two worlds \\u00ef\\u00bf\\u00bd a modern form and traditional results! But the better articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate impacts on inflation and/or interest rate expectations. The model has several advantages. The first is it may be more credible to a wider audience because of its modernization in terms of cointegration and error learning specification on the one hand and explicit use of rational expectations on the other hand. Second, the model is much more flexible in terms of research potential. It allows one to study in particular how the response to monetary or fiscal policies depends on features of the expectation formation process. Third, the model forces the user to make assumptions explicitly about expectations formation that otherwise could be avoided or hidden. Let me give two examples of policy options that can be analyzed more effectively in the new model. First, consider a deficit reduction package that is credible and promises to lower interest rates in the future. In models like MPS and WUMM, the mechanical fiscal policy simulation would ignore any \\\"bond market effect\\\" associated with changed expectations about future short-term rates. One could, of course, add-factor downward the long-term bond rate in the term structure equation to impose a bond market effect, but the structure of the model neither immediately points you in this direction nor provides any guidance about how to intervene. In FRB-US, in contrast, one cannot avoid making an explicit assumption about the credibility of such a policy (through assumptions about future short-term interest rates in the VAR expectations or in the context of model-consistent expectations) and the assumption made about credibility will importantly affect the short-run dynamics though not the long-run effects of the policy. Second, consider the transitional costs of reducing inflation. The transitional effects on output depend importantly on the assumptions made about the credibility of the inflation commitment. Note, however, that there are significant transitional output costs of disinflation even under full credibility and the model-consistent specification of rational expectations, arising from the sticky price implication of the adjustment cost specification. For my part, I prefer the FRB-US simulations based on limited rather than perfect credibility, because I do not believe that credibility effects significantly diminish the  transition costs of lowering inflation. But I also value having a disciplined approach to showing how the costs of disinflation would vary with the differing degrees of credibility.\",\n          \"For release on delivery 1:p.m. EDT (12:p.m. CDT) September 12, The \\u201cNew Normal\\u201d and What It Means for Monetary Policy Remarks by Lael Brainard Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at The Chicago Council on Global Affairs Chicago, Illinois September 12, In the months ahead, my colleagues and I will continue to assess what policy path will best promote the sustained attainment of our goals.

These contours represent noteworthy departures from the \\u201cold normal\\u201d that prevailed in the decades prior to the financial crisis.

At a time when our assessment of the economy is evolving, several features of the \\u201cnew normal\\u201d--some of which are interrelated--appear particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy. The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result. However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. - - considerably.At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.percent to 4.percent, inflation has undershot our percent target now for straight months.In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously. With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important. On expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be concerned more about undershooting than overshooting. Although some survey measures have remained well anchored at percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.Meanwhile, market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate. Thus, we cannot rule out that the sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations. Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June to June 2016. The SEP forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from initially to most recently. See Blanchard , Kiley (2015b), and Brainard (2015a), The inflation information refers to core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation measured on a 12-month average basis. For example, over the past months, median 5-to-year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/percentage point below the average over the prior - - The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy deliberations. In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling. 2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated. This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market. Indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving sideways, as it has done. It is true that today\\u2019s unemployment rate of 4.percent is only 0.percentage point from the median SEP participant\\u2019s estimate of the longer-run level of unemployment. However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary over time. Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.to 6.percent in June to 4.to 5.percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/toWe cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate may move even lower. For information from current and previous SEPs, see http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. - - In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go. The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained noticeably above its pre-crisis level. Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/percentage points below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains. While it is possible that the current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth. Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market. For analyses of the determinants of labor force participation, see Aaronson and others , Erceg and Levin , and Council of Economic Advisers .percent. Over thepercent. The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 2.percent over the past eight quarters. From the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of 2014, these measures all increased at an average annual rate of around percent. From the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an average annual rate of around 3-1/percent. Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available for this period. - - 3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks here at home.In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low. Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro area\\u2019s bank-centric financial system. A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. Against this backdrop, uncertainty about Britain\\u2019s future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in Europe. Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation. Indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains below target levels. The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into such a situation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly marked down its forecast of world economic growth in recent years. From April to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down growth from 3.percent to 3.percent. And from April to July of this year, the IMF revised downpercent to 3.percent. See the IMF\\u2019s World Economic Outlook at http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29. - - Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state- owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses. Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow. Given that China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks. Importantly, Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital outflows have slowed in recent months. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, and further volatility cannot be ruled out. The importance of Chinese growth and stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies that these risks have global implications. Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. financial markets. The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously. Indeed, recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger than they were several years ago.The fact that many advanced economies are suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S.S. exports, has decreased from an average pace of 5-1/percent from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of to a little over percent last year. The confidence intervals around the estimated effects are quite large. - - dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the U.S. economy.In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements. In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that the nearly percent appreciation of the dollar from June to January of this year could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis. Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has averaged a very modest rate upward of percent, and inflation has averaged only 1-1/percent. Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy. To reconcile these developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate is less accommodative today than it would have been years ago. Put differently, the - - amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now much lower than before the crisis. In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of percent. But seven years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the low neutral rate looks likely to persist. Indeed, developments over the past year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.Foreign consumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets. Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 2-1/percent from to 2000, has increased only 1/percent on average over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force. Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts. In the four years between June and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 4.percent to 3.percent--nearly one-third. Over one-third of that adjustment has occurred between December and June 2016. It is notable that this recent step-down in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function. For a fuller description of the likely contributors to a persistent low neutral rate, see Brainard (2015b) and Goodfriend . - - Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and slow.These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated. 5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric. With policy rates near the zero lower bound and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse developments. Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks. While there are, of course, other policy options, these alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional policy.From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against upside risks. See, for example, Laubach and Williams ; Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith ; C\\u00fardia ; Lubik and Matthes ; Kiley (2015a); and Johannsen and Mertens for econometric estimates of the neutral rate, or the closely related concept of the natural rate of interest. See the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\u2019s most recent Survey of Market Participants (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters\\u2019 estimates of the current neutral rate. - - Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate. There is a growing literature on such policy alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or deploying negative interest rates.These options merit further assessment. However, they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare. For the time being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around percent--and not a ceiling--along with maximum employment. Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic developments and their implications for policy. The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions: The labor market has continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated past near-term risks from abroad. Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewhat gradual. This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below See Romer , Blanchard, Dell\\u2019Ariccia and Mauro , Ball , Haldane , Bernanke , and Goodfriend . - - last year\\u2019s pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack. The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening 1/percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate. These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement. Recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth. In particular, real consumer spending increased at nearly a percent annual pace over the three months ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth. Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing. Weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing production. Business investment has declined in each of the past three quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed noticeably in the middle of this year. As a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each averaging less than percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015. Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year. Indeed, exports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter, and the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines over the past two years, a positive sign for business investment. In addition, inventory - - investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales. We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate. In July, the 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.percent, higher than a year ago, but still noticeably below our percent target. The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters. Non-oil import prices, which fell steadily from the end of through the first quarter of this year, edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise going forward. Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower. The evidence here is mixed, as I noted earlier. Policy Implications The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean roughly in the same direction: In today\\u2019s new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness. In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react. Moreover, because of Phillips curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy. In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is - - more limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected weakness is greater. The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable. This asymmetry in risk management in today\\u2019s new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation. I believe this approach has served us well in recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation. I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for signs of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations. - -\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Removing Footnotes"],"metadata":{"id":"TmyaoKM778Do"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import re\n","\n","# Function to remove footnotes\n","def remove_footnotes(text):\n","    # Regular expression to match footnotes that start with a space followed by a digit and a capital letter, and end with a period or dash\n","    text = re.sub(r'(?<!\\d)\\s\\d+\\s+[A-Z].*?(?:\\.|-)', '', text)\n","\n","    # Return cleaned text\n","    return text\n","\n","# Apply the function to the 'content' column\n","df['content'] = df['content'].apply(remove_footnotes)\n","\n","# Display the first 100 rows of the updated dataframe\n","df.head(100)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":2310},"id":"0rpzA1ah77Lc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727833221416,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":475,"user":{"displayName":"Aris Zoleta","userId":"05395961891629610665"}},"outputId":"c50b32c3-205f-4ba6-de0b-6308a84cc7ff"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                            content\n","0 2016-09-12  For release on delivery 1:15 p.m. EDT (12:15 p..."],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-e319b635-016b-45f6-8191-c04ff7488c2c\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>content</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2016-09-12</td>\n","      <td>For release on delivery 1:15 p.m. EDT (12:15 p...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-e319b635-016b-45f6-8191-c04ff7488c2c')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-e319b635-016b-45f6-8191-c04ff7488c2c button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

These contours represent noteworthy departures from the old normal that prevailed in the decades prior to the financial crisis. I would argue that policy today must rely less on the old normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape todays new normal.1 Key Features of the New Normal Because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the economy and shape policy accordingly. At a time when our assessment of the economy is evolving, several features of the new normal--some of which are interrelated--appear particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy. The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result. However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.- 2 - considerably.2 At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3 In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously. With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important. On expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be concerned more about undershooting than overshooting. Although some survey measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4 Meanwhile, market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate. Thus, we cannot rule out that the sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations. Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016. The SEP forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.to-10 year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior 10 years.- 3 - The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy deliberations. In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling. 2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated. This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market. Indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving sideways, as it has done. It is true that todays unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participants estimate of the longer-run level of unemployment. However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary over time. Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 tofederalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.- 4 - In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go. The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained noticeably above its pre-crisis level. Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains. While it is possible that the current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.6 This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth. Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market. Over the The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the past eight quarters. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these measures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an average annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent. Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available for this period.- 5 - 3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks here at home.8 In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low. Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro areas bank-centric financial system. A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. Against this backdrop, uncertainty about Britains future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in Europe. Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation. Indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains below target levels. The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into such a situation. From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 growth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent. And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down See the IMFs World Economic Outlook at http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29.- 6 - Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.9 Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state- owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses. Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow. Given that China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks. Importantly, Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital outflows have slowed in recent months. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, and further volatility cannot be ruled out. The importance of Chinese growth and stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies that these risks have global implications. Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. financial markets. The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously. Indeed, recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger than they were several years ago.10 The fact that many advanced economies are suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S. exports, has decreased from an average pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 percent last year. The confidence intervals around the estimated effects are quite large.- 7 - dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the U.S. economy.11 In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements. In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis. Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy. To reconcile these developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate is less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago. Put differently, the- 8 - amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now much lower than before the crisis. In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent. But seven years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the low neutral rate looks likely to persist. Indeed, developments over the past year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12 Foreign consumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets. Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force. Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts. In the four years between June 2012 and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third. Over one-third of that adjustment has occurred between December 2015 and June 2016. It is notable that this recent step-down in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.- 9 - Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and slow.13 These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated. 5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric. With policy rates near the zero lower bound and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse developments. Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks. While there are, of course, other policy options, these alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional policy.14 From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against upside risks. See the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks most recent Survey of Market Participants (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters estimates of the current neutral rate.- 10 - Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate. There is a growing literature on such policy alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or deploying negative interest rates.15 These options merit further assessment. However, they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare. For the time being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along with maximum employment. Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic developments and their implications for policy. The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions: The labor market has continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated past near-term risks from abroad. Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewhat gradual. This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below- 11 - last years pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack. The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate. These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement. Recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth. In particular, real consumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth. Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing. Weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing production. Business investment has declined in each of the past three quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed noticeably in the middle of this year. As a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015. Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year. Indeed, exports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter, and the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines over the past two years, a positive sign for business investment. In addition, inventory- 12 - investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales. We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate. In July, the 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still noticeably below our 2 percent target. The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters. Non-oil import prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise going forward. Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower. The evidence here is mixed, as I noted earlier. Policy Implications The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean roughly in the same direction: In todays new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness. In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react. Moreover, because of Phillips curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy. In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is- 13 - more limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected weakness is greater. The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable. This asymmetry in risk management in todays new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation. I believe this approach has served us well in recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation. I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for signs of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations.- 14 - References Aaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014).

These contours represent noteworthy departures from the old normal that prevailed in the decades prior to the financial crisis. I would argue that policy today must rely less on the old normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape todays new normal.1 Key Features of the New Normal Because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the economy and shape policy accordingly. At a time when our assessment of the economy is evolving, several features of the new normal--some of which are interrelated--appear particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy. The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result. However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.- 2 - considerably.2 At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3 In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously. With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important. On expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be concerned more about undershooting than overshooting. Although some survey measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4 Meanwhile, market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate. Thus, we cannot rule out that the sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations. Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016. The SEP forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.to-10 year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior 10 years.- 3 - The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy deliberations. In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling. 2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated. This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market. Indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving sideways, as it has done. It is true that todays unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participants estimate of the longer-run level of unemployment. However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary over time. Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 tofederalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.- 4 - In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go. The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained noticeably above its pre-crisis level. Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains. While it is possible that the current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.6 This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth. Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market. Over the The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the past eight quarters. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these measures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an average annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent. Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available for this period.- 5 - 3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks here at home.8 In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low. Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro areas bank-centric financial system. A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. Against this backdrop, uncertainty about Britains future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in Europe. Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation. Indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains below target levels. The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into such a situation. From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 growth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent. And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down See the IMFs World Economic Outlook at http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29.- 6 - Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.9 Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state- owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses. Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow. Given that China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks. Importantly, Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital outflows have slowed in recent months. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, and further volatility cannot be ruled out. The importance of Chinese growth and stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies that these risks have global implications. Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. financial markets. The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously. Indeed, recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger than they were several years ago.10 The fact that many advanced economies are suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S. exports, has decreased from an average pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 percent last year. The confidence intervals around the estimated effects are quite large.- 7 - dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the U.S. economy.11 In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements. In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis. Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy. To reconcile these developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate is less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago. Put differently, the- 8 - amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now much lower than before the crisis. In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent. But seven years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the low neutral rate looks likely to persist. Indeed, developments over the past year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12 Foreign consumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets. Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force. Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts. In the four years between June 2012 and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third. Over one-third of that adjustment has occurred between December 2015 and June 2016. It is notable that this recent step-down in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.- 9 - Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and slow.13 These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated. 5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric. With policy rates near the zero lower bound and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse developments. Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks. While there are, of course, other policy options, these alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional policy.14 From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against upside risks. See the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks most recent Survey of Market Participants (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters estimates of the current neutral rate.- 10 - Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate. There is a growing literature on such policy alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or deploying negative interest rates.15 These options merit further assessment. However, they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare. For the time being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along with maximum employment. Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic developments and their implications for policy. The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions: The labor market has continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated past near-term risks from abroad. Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewhat gradual. This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below- 11 - last years pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack. The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate. These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement. Recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth. In particular, real consumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth. Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing. Weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing production. Business investment has declined in each of the past three quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed noticeably in the middle of this year. As a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015. Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year. Indeed, exports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter, and the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines over the past two years, a positive sign for business investment. In addition, inventory- 12 - investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales. We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate. In July, the 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still noticeably below our 2 percent target. The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters. Non-oil import prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise going forward. Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower. The evidence here is mixed, as I noted earlier. Policy Implications The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean roughly in the same direction: In todays new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness. In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react. Moreover, because of Phillips curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy. In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is- 13 - more limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected weakness is greater. The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable. This asymmetry in risk management in todays new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation. I believe this approach has served us well in recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation. I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for signs of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations.- 14 - References Aaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014).

These contours represent noteworthy departures from the old normal that prevailed in the decades prior to the financial crisis. I would argue that policy today must rely less on the old normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape todays new normal.1 Key Features of the New Normal Because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the economy and shape policy accordingly. At a time when our assessment of the economy is evolving, several features of the new normal--some of which are interrelated--appear particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy. The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result. However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.- 2 - considerably.2 At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3 In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously. With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important. On expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be concerned more about undershooting than overshooting. Although some survey measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4 Meanwhile, market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate. Thus, we cannot rule out that the sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations. Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016. The SEP forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.to-10 year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior 10 years.- 3 - The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy deliberations. In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling. 2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated. This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market. Indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving sideways, as it has done. It is true that todays unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participants estimate of the longer-run level of unemployment. However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary over time. Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 tofederalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.- 4 - In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go. The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained noticeably above its pre-crisis level. Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains. While it is possible that the current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.6 This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth. Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market. Over the The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the past eight quarters. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these measures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an average annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent. Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available for this period.- 5 - 3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks here at home.8 In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low. Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro areas bank-centric financial system. A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. Against this backdrop, uncertainty about Britains future relationship with the European Union could damp business sentiment and investment in Europe. Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation. Indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains below target levels. The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into such a situation. From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 growth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent. And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down See the IMFs World Economic Outlook at http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29.- 6 - Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.9 Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state- owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses. Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow. Given that China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks. Importantly, Chinese authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital outflows have slowed in recent months. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, and further volatility cannot be ruled out. The importance of Chinese growth and stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies that these risks have global implications. Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. financial markets. The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously. Indeed, recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger than they were several years ago.10 The fact that many advanced economies are suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S. exports, has decreased from an average pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 percent last year. The confidence intervals around the estimated effects are quite large.- 7 - dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the U.S. economy.11 In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements. In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis. Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy. To reconcile these developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate is less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago. Put differently, the- 8 - amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now much lower than before the crisis. In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent. But seven years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the low neutral rate looks likely to persist. Indeed, developments over the past year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12 Foreign consumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets. Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force. Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts. In the four years between June 2012 and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third. Over one-third of that adjustment has occurred between December 2015 and June 2016. It is notable that this recent step-down in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.- 9 - Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and slow.13 These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated. 5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric. With policy rates near the zero lower bound and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse developments. Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks. While there are, of course, other policy options, these alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional policy.14 From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against upside risks. See the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks most recent Survey of Market Participants (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters estimates of the current neutral rate.- 10 - Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate. There is a growing literature on such policy alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or deploying negative interest rates.15 These options merit further assessment. However, they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare. For the time being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along with maximum employment. Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic developments and their implications for policy. The economy has seen welcome progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions: The labor market has continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated past near-term risks from abroad. Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewhat gradual. This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below- 11 - last years pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack. The slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate. These developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement. Recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth. In particular, real consumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth. Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing. Weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing production. Business investment has declined in each of the past three quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed noticeably in the middle of this year. As a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015. Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year. Indeed, exports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter, and the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines over the past two years, a positive sign for business investment. In addition, inventory- 12 - investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales. We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate. In July, the 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still noticeably below our 2 percent target. The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters. Non-oil import prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise going forward. Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower. The evidence here is mixed, as I noted earlier. Policy Implications The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean roughly in the same direction: In todays new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness. In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react. Moreover, because of Phillips curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy. In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is- 13 - more limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected weakness is greater. The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable. This asymmetry in risk management in todays new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation. I believe this approach has served us well in recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation. I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for signs of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations.- 14 - References Aaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014).
